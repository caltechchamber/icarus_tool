# ICARUS Tool


Timeline Generator (ICARUSTimeLineGenerator.m)

This open-source free software runs with Matlab. Note that you can download a free trial version of Matlab for 30 days. The generator can be used to create a new experiment timeline before or during an experiment in order to record and organize the key actions performed and the time (in HH:MM) that they take place. One can edit an existing timeline or reorder the actions based on the time entries. It can also save the timeline with customizable filename in the ICARUS readable format (.csv) for future analysis and dataset uploading. The timeline generator comes with a list of common actions to conduct chamber experiments, which can be used as a general experimental protocol. The user can simply start with the default actions and enter times or make changes as needed. This software was developed by the Seinfeld group at Caltech.
